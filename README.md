## FAQ
* Why did you choose this subject?
> React is awesome and manipulates the virtual DOM allowing do re-rendering and loading to almost not exist  

* How were you first made aware of it?
> Adrian had an advanced lesson on it  

* What problem does it solve?
> React is a UI library developed at Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive, stateful & reusable UI components. It is used at Facebook in production, and Instagram.com is written entirely in React.

* How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
> It allows us to render the view in the MVC much faster because it only re-renders specific parts of the DOM and not the entire page. This is done via diffing and the creation of the virtual DOM which mirrors the regular DOM

* Why does one use it?  
> Because it is scalable and quick and allows you to be very specific on the DOM elements you want to update

* What are the alternatives?
> RiotJS, Angular, Ember

* What is it similar to, if anything?
>  Not much it was developed out of necessity and introduces JSX  

* What is the history of this technology?
** ReactJS started as a JavaScript port of XHP, a version of PHP which Facebook released four years ago. XHP was principally concerned with minimizing Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. But, there was a distinct problem with XHP: dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. So, a Facebook engineer negotiated with his manager to take XHP into the browser using JavaScript and was granted six months to try it.

* Who built it and why?  
> React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML components framework for PHP

* Who is maintaining it?
> Facebook

* What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
>  It is super fast and allows us to render changes without impacted the full DOM

* What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
>  Thinking in terms of their own specific components, it's difficult because it combines markup language and JS  

* What resources do you recommend for interested students?
 > facebook.github.io/react

* What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
> Going through their official docs they are pretty solid and well documented

* What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
> What is the virtual DOM? How does a composite support separate of concerns? Where does react fit in, in the MVC pattern?
